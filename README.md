## Personal Movie Logger!

your glitch (or alternative server) link e.g. http://a3-C-Slat.glitch.me

Include a very brief summary of your project here. Images are encouraged, along with concise, high-level text. Be sure to include:

- This project aims to allow users to login to a unique profile where they can write reviews about movies they've seen, give it a rating, 
  and even a review if they'd like, as well as allowing them to delete or modify existing entries if they re-watch a film and have an updated opinion!

- When creating this application, the biggest struggle was connecting to the backend as I have never dealt with databases before now, so it was a little bit of a tough time!
- I also had a hard time when I tried implementing the login functionality because it started making my frontend info disappear even though it was still communicating with the database correctly.

- I ended up authenticating with localStorage because when the assignment first came out I was using Passport, and it was giving me issues, so I went for a simpler approach and it worked better for me.
- I went with Bootstrap for my CSS style framework as it is the most popular, has a lot of information about it online so I could get the most help, and I'm still getting my feet wet with web-design so I thought it would be the easiest.
  - I customized some colors in Bootstrap's original palette to use colors I liked more and fit better with my website, as well as styled my fonts and buttons differently.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I hosted my application on Vercel as well as Glitch, they work very similarly, but I have to say I dislike navigating Glitch a lot more and it doesn't feel as user friendly.
