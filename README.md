## Personal Movie Logger!

- IMPORTANT: I was unable to get my full authentication to work using React but was successfully able to do it in JS/HTML. For this reason, I have included my attempt with React in GitHub even though it's not fully functional, I thought it would be better to include both my working JS/HTML as well as the work I did in React to represent the effort I had put in to get it working.

- Since assignment 3, I successfully added a method to allow users to log in with GitHub and utilize that information the same way it was being used in the MongoDB.
- Both MongoDB and GitHub users can login, add movies to their profile, edit existing ratings or reviews by inputting duplicate movies, and delete movies they no longer want in the table.
- Once users are logged in, if they have multiple profiles they're able to go back to the login page, log in as a different user, and they will see the movies stored for that unique user and any previously logged in users information is removed.
